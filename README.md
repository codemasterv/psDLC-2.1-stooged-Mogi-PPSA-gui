thank you stooged for the cool tool!

just launch psDLC.exe on your windows machine and you are good to go.

So some dlc like your AC:V changed the name format of the dlc from CUSA to PPSA



I just modified the psDLC stooged 2.0 to support the PPSA dlc fkpg



you can find it here

This is only for PPSA DLC



Use the psDLC stooged 2.0 gui to make cusa files because that still works



here is how it works

Get the title of the DLC from the top starting with EP and ending with 001, Its highlighted in the photo.



Next put that into the tool after clicking on Manual Input and click CreatefPkg

Then open the fake_dlc_pkg folder in the same directory as the psDLC.exe you will find your unlocker. This only works if the AC data is included with the game or has been installed via psn/ fpkg-ac
